Now
[ ] load the extra node metadata

I think session name is hardcoded in left-hand panel

- size of wizard panel
- text formatting (e.g., use of h3) inside wizrd panel
- title of cards
- a link saying "I have no more data"

move the cards to a separate director than the re-used selectors

start with expanded examples


// - show only one step of wizard at a time
// only show save button at appropriate time
// buttons to save and open vis





Future enhancements:
- handle tables that use node id instead of label 
- allow NodeMetadataConfig to load data from multiple files
- warn if same field selected for multiple things
- better handling of misisng times: currently they become unix time 0
- import of latitude and longitude, rather than geocoding
- correcting incorrect geocoding
- uploading a location file
